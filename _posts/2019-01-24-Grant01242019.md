Yesterday, we had our first meeting with our customer point-of-contact for SQS, which in my opinion went very well. We talked with our 
contact, Ben Fox, about the history and requirements of the project we're working on. Our project is to create a new section of SQS's 
training website that will allow sales users to search for employees with certain skills from a database and then compare their 
resumes to find the ideal employee for a project. I think that this meeting was very successful in establishing the initial requirements 
of the project, and I walked away with a confident understanding in the work we have to do.

After hearing the details and requirements for the "Employee Selector & Resume Generator" project, I am confident in my ability to 
contribute to this project. For the majority of my internship I have been working with a project similar to this one, where I've also had 
to build by work off of an existing code base. Similar to the "Employee Selector & Resume Generator" project, this project is also a 
web-based application that is heavily integrated with a large database. From my interniship, I've also gained a lot of experience in 
testing programs like this, so I'll be really prepared for that phrase of the project. Overall, I'm very excited to begin work on this 
project and I already can't wait to see what the final product looks like.
