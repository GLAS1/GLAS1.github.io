Yesterday on January 23, we had our first meeting with our customer point-of-contact. We were able to determine a time that worked for all the members of our team, and the meeting went very well. Three previous semesters of CS 499 students have worked to build the website to which we will be adding additional functionality. This will be my first exposure to working on a project that already exists, as opposed to building something from the ground up, and I anticipate that this might be a little bit difficult to get used to.

Additionally, after hearing more details about the "Employee Selector & Resume Generator" project, I realized that it sounds similar to a project I completed in CS 405: Databases. In CS 405, Sara and I worked together to create an infectious disease database and a simple website that could query this database on various parameters. Similarly, one of the main goals of this project is to create a "Sales" user that can query a database holding employee information. Though this project is more complex, I anticipate being able to use the foundation of skills I built in CS 405. Additionally, I know Grant and Lexi also took CS 405, and I consider it an advantage that all of us already possess the basic skills necessary for what we need to accomplish.
