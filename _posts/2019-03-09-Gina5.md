Our first sprint ends on Monday, March 11th. I just finished up my part of the sprint. I had two parts-to change the sign in functionality to accommodate Sales Users and to create the page and search box for the Employee Search page. The first part was far easier than expected- though I am not happy with a lot of what the previous group did, they formatted the sign-in in a model, view, controller format that made it very easy to extend its functionality. The second part was a little more complicated because I had to spend some time figuring out how to make the look of this new page match the look of all the other pages. The search box is heavily tied to Lexi's part of the sprint (doing the search) as well as Grant's part of the sprint (showing the search results). I am hoping we have few problems integrating the parts together, but I recognize that might lead to a little hiccup.

The largest roadblock we've hit so far is that we've realized that the previous groups did not add functionality for user skills. They hardcoded a useless GUI that looks like it's doing stuff but does not interact with the database at all. As we were operating under the assumption that users already had the ability to add skills, this greatly impacted our schedule. We added fixing this as part of our next sprint and dropped off some of the lower level functionality. I hope we won't run into any other problems like this.
